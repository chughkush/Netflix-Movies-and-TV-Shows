## Netflix Analysis using Tableau

**NOTE :**  Dataset and problem statement has been collected by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows).

Github is not displaying the images that have been uploaded, so you can find the compiled notebook on my Kaggle profile [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/kushagrachugh/netflix-analysis-using-tableau).

I have used Tableau to analyse and get insights from the Netflix dataset. All the charts are uploaded on Imgur as jpgs, and then used in the Jupyter notebook to showcase the charts.

### Context
The dataset consists of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of January 2021. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
